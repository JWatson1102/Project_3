# Project_3

Hello, welcome to our project!  We wanted to bring the spooky to you to peruse at your leisure.  

Please find above our source data files which we cleaned up and sifted through.  You can also find the databases we created with these.

When you arrive at our webpage, you will see a spooooky music option - we recommend you give it a try for the full effect!
